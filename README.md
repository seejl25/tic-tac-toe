# tic-tac-toe
Creating a tic-tac-toe game from TheOdinProject

Steps taken:
- Create a gameboard that allows player one and player two to make their selection by clicking on the buttons on the gameboard
- Selections made by players are saved inside an array
- Winner is determined by checking values in array where as long as there is 3 in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the corresponding player wins. Else, it is a draw
- New game button that resets and create a new board
- Once a winner has been determined or game has come to a draw, all buttons on the game board are disabled and players will need to restart by clicking on "New Game"
